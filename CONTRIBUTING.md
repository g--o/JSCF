# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Focus

Currently we are focusing on:
- **Documentation:** good documentation of the API and how to properly use the lib.
- **Testing:** using the lib for cool projects and experiments to ensure it's going the way it's meant to be and proving it's usefulness.
- **Active development:** currently in prototype we want to get our first major release.

## Pull Request Process

**Note:** *For now* we accept both branches & forks. But please keep it tidy.

1. Make sure your changes are covered by our tests, and add a relevant one if they aren't.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. Minify your code (you can use my package for this [minify-js](https://atom.io/packages/minify-j-s)).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Non-profit

As the project is non-profit, contributors will be rewarded only by the final product, but hopefully also pride.
