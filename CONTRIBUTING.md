# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method before writing the code.
Ideally, pay attention to the *priority* and to the *help needed* tags of the issue.

## Focus

Currently we are focusing on:
- **Active development:** currently in prototype we want to get our first major release.
- **Testing:** using the lib for cool projects and experiments to ensure it's going the way it's meant to be and proving it's usefulness.
- **Documentation:** good documentation of the API and how to properly use the lib.

## Pull Request Process

**Note:** *For now* we accept both branches & forks. But please keep it tidy.

1. Make sure your changes are covered by our tests, and add a relevant one if they aren't.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before sending changes.
4. Minify your code (you can use my package for this [minify-js](https://atom.io/packages/minify-j-s)).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once a reviewer approved your changes.

## Non-profit

As the project is non-profit, contributors will be rewarded only by the final product, but hopefully also pride.
