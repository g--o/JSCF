**JavaScript Canvas Framework.**

This is a framework and engine for canvas and javascript **based on pure JS & CanvasInput only**.
The approach is to allow extendibility while adhering to concepts from popular
engines like *Unity*. It's open source and free now and forever.

JSCF tries to be as independent library as possible and as cross-platform & as backwards-compatible as possible, so that it can be incorporated in different contexts.

## Gettting JSCF
JSCF is in development. Only prototype version is available. You can get a prototype build from [release/jscf.js](release/jscf.js), and editor from the `editor` directory.

jscf.js is a *minified* version. see the wiki for non-compact code hacking.
