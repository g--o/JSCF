# JSCF

**JavaScript Canvas Framework.**

This is a framework and engine for canvas and javascript **based on pure JS & CanvasInput only**.
The approach is to allow extendibility while adhering to concepts from popular
engines like *Unity*. It's open source and free now and forever.

JSCF tries to be as independent library as possible and as cross-platform & as backwards-compatible as possible, so that it can be incorporated in different contexts.

## Gettting JSCF
JSCF is in development. Only prototype version is available. You can get a prototype build from [release/jscf.js](release/jscf.js), and editor from the `editor` directory.

jscf.js is a *minified* version. see the wiki for non-compact code hacking.

## Help up!

**JSCF isn't finished** -- it's still young and you can help shape it. You can start by reading CONTRIBUTING.md and looking for open issues.

**Share your JSCF projects** - let me know about your experience in JSCF projects, i'll be happy to support and be supported.
