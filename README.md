# JSCF

**JavaScript Canvas Framework.**

This is a game & ui library **based on vanilla JS & CanvasInput only!**
The approach is to allow extendibility while adhering to concepts from popular
engines like *Unity*. It's open source and free now and forever.

Another goal is to keep JSCF as independent library as possible and as cross-platform & backwards-compatible as possible.

Lastly, JSCF should be desktop AND mobile targeted, while keeping good performance.

## Gettting JSCF
JSCF is in development. Only prototype version is available. You can get a prototype build from [release/jscf.js](release/jscf.js).

jscf.js is a *minified* version. To work with non-compact code you need to manually include the core modules + needed modules & components. This helps loading only whatever is neccessary and helps us debug problems.
