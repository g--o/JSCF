## JSCF Documentation

JSCF is built out of core classes and components.
These documents contain the API of these classes and are generated via jsdoc.

**Note that the namespaces represent the file tree only. When coding with JSCF do NOT use namespaces, and you do NOT need to require modules! (everything's in global scope and minified)**


For more info you can check out the project wiki: [here](https://github.com/g--o/JSCF/wiki)
