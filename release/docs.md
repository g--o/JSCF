## JSCF Documentation

JSCF is built out of core classes and components.
These documents contain only the API of these classes and are generated via jsdoc.


For more info you can check out the project wiki: [here](https://github.com/g--o/JSCF/wiki)

## Getting started

If you want to understand JSCF the best entry point would be [jscf.js](jscf.js.html) and the [Game](Game.html) class.
Next, you should try to understand the different managers at play: [InputManager](InputManager.html),
[ResourceManager](ResourceManager.html) and [GuiManager](GuiManager.html) to name a few.
